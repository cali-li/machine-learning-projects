## Question 3

### 3(a)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#loads package
library(ISLR)
data(Weekly)

#fit logistic model
logistic_model = glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2, data = Weekly, family = binomial)
summary(logistic_model)
```


### 3(b)

```{r}
#leave-the-first-one-out logistic model
logistic_model_leave1 = glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2, data = Weekly[-1,], family = binomial)
summary(logistic_model_leave1)

### 3(c)

```{r}
#predicts the direction of the first observation
sum(logistic_model_leave1$coefficients*cbind(1,Weekly[1,2:3]))
